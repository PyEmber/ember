# Ember CLI Status

## Current Status

The Ember CLI is currently being developed separately from the core Python framework. It has been excluded from the main development workflow and git tracking to allow for independent development and prevent integration issues.

## Structure

The CLI is built with:
- TypeScript/Node.js
- Commander.js for command-line parsing
- Python-bridge for communication with the Python framework

## Key Components

1. **Command Modules**
   - model.ts - Manage LLM models
   - provider.ts - Manage providers
   - invoke.ts - Invoke models
   - config.ts - Manage configuration
   - project.ts - Project scaffolding
   - version.ts - Version information

2. **Services**
   - config-manager.ts - Manage CLI configuration
   - python-bridge.ts - Interface with the Python framework

3. **UI Components**
   - Spinners, progress bars, banners
   - Interactive prompts

The CLI is currently excluded from the standard installation. When development resumes, it will be available as a separate package or optional component.
