# XCS Architecture

The Executable Computation System (XCS) provides a high-performance execution framework built around computational graphs, tracing, and parallelization. This document describes the architectural design behind XCS.

## System Architecture

XCS is built with a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns and enables flexibility:

## Key Components

### API Layer

The API layer provides a simplified interface for users of the XCS system. It:
- Exposes core functionality through clean, simple imports
- Handles type conversion and validation
- Provides sensible defaults for complex operations

**Key Files:**
- `api/core.py`: Core API implementation
- `api/types.py`: Type definitions and validators

### Tracer Layer

The tracer layer is responsible for just-in-time compilation and execution tracing:
- Records operator calls and data flow
- Analyzes code structure for optimization
- Constructs execution graphs from traces

**Key Components:**
- `tracer_decorator.py`: JIT compilation functionality
- `structural_jit.py`: Structure-aware JIT optimization
- `autograph.py`: Automatic graph construction
- `xcs_tracing.py`: Core tracing infrastructure

### Engine Layer

The engine layer handles the execution of computational graphs:
- Schedules operations for efficient execution
- Manages concurrency and parallelism
- Handles data flow between operations

**Key Components:**
- `xcs_engine.py`: Core execution engine
- `execution_options.py`: Configuration for execution
- `xcs_parallel_scheduler.py`: Parallel execution scheduler
- `xcs_noop_scheduler.py`: No-operation scheduler for testing

### Graph Layer

The graph layer provides a representation for computational graphs:
- Defines node and edge structures
- Manages graph transformation
- Handles serialization and deserialization

**Key Components:**
- `xcs_graph.py`: Graph implementation

### Transform Layer

The transform layer provides functional transformations for operators:
- Vectorization (vmap) for batch processing
- Parallelization (pmap) for concurrent execution
- Mesh sharding for distributed execution

**Key Components:**
- `vmap.py`: Vectorized mapping implementation
- `pmap.py`: Parallel mapping implementation
- `mesh.py`: Sharded execution on device meshes

### Utility Layer

The utility layer provides common functionality used across the codebase:
- Tree manipulation utilities
- Type handling and conversions
- Common data structures

**Key Components:**
- `tree_util.py`: Tree manipulation utilities

## Data Flow

The typical data flow through the XCS system:

1. User code calls a JIT-decorated operator
2. The tracer intercepts the call and analyzes the operator structure
3. A computational graph is constructed (automatically or explicitly)
4. The graph is passed to the execution engine
5. The engine schedules operations based on dependencies
6. Operations are executed according to the schedule
7. Results are collected and returned to the caller

## Design Principles

XCS is built on several key design principles:

1. **Immutability**: Data structures are immutable to enable easy reasoning and parallelization
2. **Composability**: Transforms and operations can be freely composed
3. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with runtime protocol checking
4. **Fail-Fast**: Errors are detected early and reported clearly
5. **Performance**: Design choices prioritize efficient execution
6. **Testability**: Components are designed for easy testing

## Extension Points

XCS can be extended in several ways:

1. **Custom Schedulers**: Implement new scheduling strategies for the execution engine
2. **New Transforms**: Add new functional transformations
3. **Graph Optimizers**: Create optimization passes for computational graphs
4. **Custom Tracers**: Implement specialized tracing for specific operator types

## Performance Considerations

XCS is designed for high-performance execution:

1. **Graph Caching**: Compiled graphs are cached for repeated execution
2. **Intelligent Scheduling**: Operations are scheduled based on data dependencies
3. **Parallel Execution**: Independent operations are executed concurrently
4. **Minimal Overhead**: Core execution paths are optimized for minimal overhead
5. **Memory Efficiency**: Data structures are designed to minimize memory usage
